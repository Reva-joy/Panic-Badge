# Panic-Badge

Innovative wearable safety badge built to act as a discreet panic alert system at a time when personal safety is a growing concern. With just a simple tap, PanicBadge lets someone signal for help instantly, without fumbling for their smartphone â€” ensuring quick assistance in critical situations and creating immediate local awareness using the audio module 

What makes it different from existing solutions is that most rely only on apps or internet, but PanicBadge works independently using GSM SMS alerts, making it reliable even without internet.
We built it on the Renesas RA6E2 MCU, combining sensors, GSM, GPS, and voice module into a compact, wearable form.
